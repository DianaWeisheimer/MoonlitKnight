Moonlit Knight 🌙⚔️

Moonlit Knight is a third-person Action RPG (Soulslike) developed in Unity using C#. The project focuses on challenging combat mechanics, state-machine-based AI, and atmospheric world-building.

Overview
This project serves as my primary sandbox for implementing advanced software engineering patterns in game development. While currently in active development, the core engine features a robust architecture designed for scalability and performance.

    Genre: Soulslike / Action RPG

    Engine: Unity 6 (High Definition Render Pipeline)

    Platform: PC

Technical Implementation
To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, I implemented several software engineering patterns:

    State Machine Pattern: Used for Player Controller and Enemy AI to manage complex transitions between animations and behaviors (Idle, Attack, Dodge, Stagger).

    Singleton & Observer Patterns: Implemented for Game Managers and UI Event systems to decouple game logic from the interface.

    Scriptable Objects: Utilized for data-driven design (Item stats, Enemy attributes, and Audio management), allowing for easy balancing without touching the core code.

    Asynchronous Programming: Used Task and Coroutines for smooth scene loading and VFX management.
